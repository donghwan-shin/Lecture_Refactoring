# Refactoring

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Task: Apply appropriate refactoring techniques to the code

If you look at the code in `main.py`, you can see that it is not ideal.
Apply appropriate refactoring techniques to improve the code quality.

The following list of refactoring techniques might be useful:
- Extract Function
- Inline Function
- Extract Variable
- Inline Variable
- Rename Variable
- Decompose Conditional
- Parametrise Function
- Move Function
- Move Field

NOTE: Do not modify tests in the `tests` directory.

## Mini Report

After completing the above task, push the changes to the repository and include a short report to summarise what you have done for the task. 

Your discussions/reflections are also recommended. For example, you can discuss the following points:
- What refactoring techniques did you apply?
- What was the reason for applying these techniques?
- What are the benefits of applying these techniques?
- What are the drawbacks of applying these techniques?
- Overall, how do you feel about the refactoring process? Worth it? Why (or why not)?
